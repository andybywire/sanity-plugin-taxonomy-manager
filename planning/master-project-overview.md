# Master Project Overview: Sanity Taxonomy Manager Optimization

## Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of the complete optimization effort for the Sanity Taxonomy Manager plugin. The work is divided into five sequential projects that build upon each other, each focusing on specific aspects of improvement while incorporating the cursor rules and development standards.

## Project Sequence

### Project 1: Foundation & Learning Setup
**Status:** Ready to start  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Focus:** Development standards, testing infrastructure, initial learning

**Key Deliverables:**
- Enhanced cursor rules for Sanity development
- Vitest testing infrastructure with React Testing Library
- ESLint configuration with strict TypeScript rules
- Initial test examples and patterns
- Updated development documentation

**Dependencies:** None (foundational project)

---

### Project 2: Code Review & Optimization
**Status:** Depends on Project 1  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Focus:** TypeScript improvements, performance optimization, code quality

**Key Deliverables:**
- Zero `any` types in codebase
- React performance optimizations (memo, useCallback, useMemo)
- Optimized GROQ queries and Sanity client usage
- Enhanced error handling and accessibility
- Improved code organization and maintainability

**Dependencies:** Project 1 (Foundation & Learning Setup)

---

### Project 3: Content Releases Integration
**Status:** Depends on Projects 1 & 2  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Focus:** Sanity content versioning system, draft management

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete understanding of Sanity content releases
- Full content releases support in all plugin functionality
- Version-aware queries and operations
- Comprehensive content releases testing
- User and developer documentation for content releases

**Dependencies:** Projects 1 & 2 (Foundation & Code Optimization)

---

### Project 4: Comprehensive Testing Implementation
**Status:** Depends on Projects 1, 2 & 3  
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks  
**Focus:** TDD principles, high test coverage, testing best practices

**Key Deliverables:**
- 90%+ test coverage across codebase
- Unit tests for all functions and components
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance and accessibility testing
- Testing patterns and documentation

**Dependencies:** Projects 1, 2 & 3 (Foundation, Optimization & Content Releases)

---

### Project 5: Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
**Status:** Depends on Projects 1, 2, 3 & 4  
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks  
**Focus:** Comprehensive documentation, knowledge transfer

**Key Deliverables:**
- Updated user documentation and guides
- Complete developer documentation and API docs
- Architecture and testing documentation
- Knowledge sharing resources and training materials
- Maintenance procedures and guidelines

**Dependencies:** All previous projects

## Overall Timeline
- **Total Duration:** 10-15 weeks
- **Sequential Execution:** Each project builds on the previous
- **Flexible Timeline:** Can be adjusted based on learnings and priorities

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] Zero `any` types in codebase
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] All content releases scenarios working
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable
- [ ] ESLint passes with strict rules

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] All public APIs documented
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

- [ ] Development standards established

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Plugin works seamlessly with content releases
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with large datasets
- [ ] User documentation is clear and helpful
- [ ] Error messages are meaningful
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified

## Key Principles

### Learning-Focused Approach
- Each project includes learning objectives
- Document insights and patterns discovered
- Focus on understanding "why" not just "how"
- Build knowledge for future development

### Quality Over Speed
- Prioritize maintainability and readability
- Establish patterns that scale
- Document decisions and rationale
- Ensure long-term sustainability

### User-Centric Development
- Consider end-user experience throughout
- Test with real scenarios and data
- Validate accessibility and usability
- Document user-facing features clearly

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Content Releases Complexity:** Dedicated project to understand and implement
- **Performance Issues:** Early optimization and monitoring
- **Testing Coverage:** Comprehensive testing strategy with TDD
- **TypeScript Migration:** Gradual improvement with strict mode

### Process Risks
- **Scope Creep:** Clear project boundaries and dependencies
- **Knowledge Loss:** Comprehensive documentation and knowledge sharing
- **Quality Issues:** Established standards and review processes
- **Timeline Delays:** Flexible approach with learning focus

## Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Start with Project 1:** Foundation & Learning Setup
2. **Review current codebase:** Understand existing patterns and issues
3. **Set up development environment:** Ensure all tools are ready
4. **Begin with first task:** Review and update goals based on current state

### Success Factors
- **Sequential Execution:** Complete each project before moving to the next
- **Regular Reviews:** Update plans based on learnings and discoveries
- **Documentation:** Capture insights and decisions throughout
- **Testing:** Validate improvements at each stage
- **User Feedback:** Test with real scenarios and data

## Notes
- Each project includes a "Review and Update Goals" step to ensure alignment
- Plans can be modified based on discoveries and learnings
- Focus on establishing patterns that will benefit future development
- Maintain flexibility while ensuring quality and completeness
