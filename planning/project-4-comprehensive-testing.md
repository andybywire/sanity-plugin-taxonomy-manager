- [ ] Validate input validation and error states

### P4.2.3 Test Management Components
- [ ] Write tests for `src/components/TopConcepts.tsx`
- [ ] Write tests for `src/components/Children.tsx`
- [ ] Write tests for `src/components/Orphans.tsx`
- [ ] Test user interactions and state changes
- [ ] Validate component integration

## Phase 4.3: Integration Testing

### P4.3.1 Test Complete Workflows

- [ ] Test responsive behavior
- [ ] Test different screen sizes
- [ ] Validate consistent behavior
- [ ] Document browser-specific considerations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] All public functions and components tested
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete workflows
- [ ] Performance and accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Testing documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] TDD patterns are established for future development

## Dependencies
