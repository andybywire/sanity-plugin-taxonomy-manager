# Project 4: Comprehensive Testing Implementation

## Overview
Build on the optimized and content-releases-ready codebase from Projects 1-3 to implement comprehensive testing using TDD principles. This project focuses on achieving high test coverage, implementing testing best practices, and ensuring the plugin's reliability and maintainability.

## Current Phase
**Phase 4.1: Unit Testing Foundation**

## Notes
### Steps to improve testing coverage
- Test more functions - Start with the most important ones
- Focus on public APIs - Functions that other code depends on
- Test utility functions - They're usually easy to test
- Test React components - Even basic rendering tests help
### Priority Order:
- Utility functions (src/helpers/, src/queries.ts) - Easy to test
- Custom hooks (src/hooks/) - Important for functionality
- React components (src/components/) - User-facing functionality

## Overall Progress
- [x] Testing infrastructure configured (from Project 1)
- [x] Initial test examples created (11 tests passing)
- [ ] Unit testing foundation established
- [ ] Integration testing implemented
- [ ] Test coverage targets achieved
- [ ] Testing documentation completed

## Current Coverage Status (July 8, 2025)
- **Statements:** 79% (Good baseline)

- **Target:** 90%+ across all metrics

## Goals
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage across the codebase
- Implement TDD principles and testing best practices
