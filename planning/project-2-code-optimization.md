# Project 2: Code Review & Optimization

## Overview
Build on the foundation established in Project 1 to strengthen type safety, eliminate `any` types, and optimize performance. This project focuses on improving code quality and maintainability while learning advanced TypeScript patterns and React optimization techniques.

## Current Phase
**Phase 2.1: TypeScript Improvements**

## Overall Progress
- [ ] TypeScript improvements implemented
- [ ] Performance optimizations completed
- [ ] Code quality enhanced
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Goals
- Strengthen type safety and eliminate `any` types
- Implement React performance optimizations
- Optimize GROQ queries and Sanity client usage
- Improve code maintainability and readability

## Phase 2.1: TypeScript Improvements

### P2.1.1 Review and Update Goals
- [ ] Review Project 1 completion and identify TypeScript priorities
- [ ] Analyze current codebase for type safety issues
- [ ] Update this plan based on actual codebase state
- [ ] Identify specific areas needing type improvements

### P2.1.2 Create Comprehensive Type Definitions
- [ ] Review existing types in `src/types.tsx`
- [ ] Create enhanced type definitions for SKOS concepts and schemes
- [ ] Add proper interfaces for plugin configuration
- [ ] Define types for all component props
- [ ] Create utility types for common patterns

### P2.1.3 Refactor Components for Type Safety
- [ ] Replace `any` types with specific interfaces
- [ ] Add proper prop types for all components
- [ ] Implement proper error handling with typed errors
- [ ] Update hook return types and parameters
- [ ] Add type guards where necessary

### P2.1.4 Update Schema Types
- [ ] Review schema types for TypeScript compliance
- [ ] Ensure all schema types use proper Sanity patterns
- [ ] Add proper validation rules with typed error messages
- [ ] Update input components with proper types

## Phase 2.2: Performance Optimization

### P2.2.1 React Performance Improvements
- [ ] Implement `React.memo` for expensive components
- [ ] Add `useCallback` and `useMemo` where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize list rendering with proper keys
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Add performance monitoring hooks

### P2.2.2 Query Optimization
- [ ] Review and optimize GROQ queries in `src/queries.ts`
- [ ] Add proper indexing hints
- [ ] Implement query result caching
- [ ] Optimize `useListeningQuery` usage
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary client calls

### P2.2.3 Component Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Break down large components into smaller, focused ones
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Optimize component tree structure
- [ ] Improve accessibility patterns

## Phase 2.3: Code Quality and Maintainability

### P2.3.1 Code Organization
- [ ] Review and improve file structure
- [ ] Group related functionality in modules
- [ ] Improve import/export patterns
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions

### P2.3.2 Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Improve error messages and user feedback
- [ ] Add error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Handle edge cases gracefully

### P2.3.3 Accessibility Enhancements
- [ ] Review and improve semantic HTML usage
- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels and roles
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Test with accessibility tools
- [ ] Document accessibility requirements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero `any` types in the codebase
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable
- [ ] All components have proper prop types
- [ ] Error handling is consistent and robust
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Code is well-documented and maintainable

## Dependencies
- Project 1: Foundation & Learning Setup (completed)

## Notes
- Build on the testing infrastructure from Project 1
- Use the established development standards
- Document all type improvements for future reference
- Focus on maintainability over clever solutions
