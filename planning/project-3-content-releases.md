# Project 3: Content Releases Integration

## Overview
Build on the optimized codebase from Projects 1 and 2 to ensure full support for Sanity's content releases feature. This project focuses on understanding and implementing proper content versioning, draft management, and version ID handling throughout the plugin.

## Current Phase
**Phase 3.1: Content Releases Understanding**

## Overall Progress

- [ ] Implementation gaps identified
- [ ] Full content releases support implemented
- [ ] Testing and documentation completed

## Goals
- Fully understand Sanity's content versioning system
- Implement complete content releases support
- Ensure all plugin functionality works with drafts and versions
- Create comprehensive testing for content releases scenarios

## Phase 3.1: Content Releases Understanding

### P3.1.1 Review and Update Goals
- [ ] Review Projects 1 and 2 completion status
- [ ] Analyze current content releases implementation
- [ ] Update this plan based on actual codebase state
- [ ] Identify specific content releases requirements

### P3.1.2 Study Sanity Content Releases
- [ ] Research Sanity's content releases documentation
- [ ] Understand draft vs published vs versioned documents
- [ ] Learn about `@sanity/id-utils` functions
- [ ] Study content lake structure and versioning
- [ ] Document key concepts and patterns

### P3.1.3 Audit Current Implementation
- [ ] Review existing content releases code in hooks
- [ ] Analyze `useCreateConcept.tsx` implementation
- [ ] Check other hooks for content releases handling
- [ ] Identify gaps and inconsistencies
- [ ] Document current behavior vs expected behavior

### P3.1.4 Create Content Releases Test Suite
- [ ] Design comprehensive test scenarios
- [ ] Create tests for draft mode operations
- [ ] Create tests for release mode operations
- [ ] Test version ID generation and handling
- [ ] Document test patterns for content releases

## Phase 3.2: Complete Content Releases Implementation

### P3.2.1 Update Hook Implementations
- [ ] Update `useCreateConcept` for full content releases support
- [ ] Update `useRemoveConcept` for version-aware operations
- [ ] Update `useAddTitle` for proper version handling
- [ ] Update all input components for content releases
- [ ] Ensure consistent version ID handling

### P3.2.2 Update Query System
- [ ] Modify `trunkBuilder` for version-aware queries
- [ ] Update `branchBuilder` for proper version filtering
- [ ] Add version-aware filtering to all queries
- [ ] Optimize queries for content releases performance
- [ ] Test query behavior with different document states

### P3.2.3 Update Schema and Input Components
- [ ] Review schema types for content releases compatibility
- [ ] Update input components for version-aware operations
- [ ] Ensure proper ID generation in all components
- [ ] Add content releases support to custom inputs
- [ ] Test schema behavior with drafts and versions

## Phase 3.3: Testing and Validation

### P3.3.1 Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all content releases scenarios
- [ ] Create integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Validate performance with large datasets
- [ ] Test cross-version compatibility

### P3.3.2 User Experience Testing
- [ ] Test plugin behavior in different content states
- [ ] Validate UI feedback for version operations
- [ ] Test error handling for version conflicts
- [ ] Ensure smooth user experience across versions
- [ ] Document user-facing content releases behavior

### P3.3.3 Documentation and Training
- [ ] Create content releases user guide
- [ ] Document technical implementation details
- [ ] Provide examples and best practices
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update developer documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All content releases scenarios tested and working
- [ ] Zero content releases related bugs
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for versioning
- [ ] User documentation is clear and complete
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with versioned content
- [ ] All plugin features work correctly with releases

## Dependencies
- Project 1: Foundation & Learning Setup (completed)
- Project 2: Code Review & Optimization (completed)

## Notes
- Build on the testing infrastructure and optimized code from previous projects
