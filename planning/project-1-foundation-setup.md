# Project 1: Foundation & Learning Setup

## Overview
Establish consistent code quality standards, development practices, and testing infrastructure for the Sanity Taxonomy Manager plugin. This project focuses on setting up the foundational tools and patterns that will be used throughout the optimization process.

## Current Phase
**Phase 1.1: Development Standards Setup**

## Overall Progress
- [x] Development standards established
- [x] Testing infrastructure configured
- [x] First tests written
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Goals
- Add cursor rules following Sanity and React development best practices
- Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure with Vitest
- Establish TypeScript strict mode and ESLint configuration
- Create initial test examples and patterns

## Phase 1.1: Development Standards Setup

### P1.1.1 Review and Update Goals
- [x] Review current project state and identify immediate needs
- [x] Update this plan based on current codebase analysis
- [x] Identify any gaps in the original testing-and-optimization.md plan

### P1.1.2 Create Enhanced Cursor Rules
- [x] Review existing `.cursor/rules/` files for completeness
- [x] Create or update rules for Sanity-specific development patterns
- [x] Add TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- [x] Include testing patterns and expectations
- [x] Document content releases handling requirements

### P1.1.3 Update ESLint Configuration
- [x] Review current ESLint configuration
- [x] Add stricter TypeScript rules
- [x] Configure React hooks rules
- [x] Add accessibility linting rules
- [x] Test configuration with current codebase

## Phase 1.2: Testing Infrastructure Setup

### P1.2.1 Install Testing Dependencies
- [x] Install Vitest and related packages
- [x] Install React Testing Library
- [x] Install testing utilities for Sanity client mocking
- [x] Update package.json with test scripts

### P1.2.2 Configure Testing Environment
- [x] Create `vitest.config.ts` with proper settings
- [x] Set up test setup file with global mocks
- [x] Configure coverage reporting
- [x] Set up test environment for React components

### P1.2.3 Create Initial Test Examples
- [x] Write first test for a simple utility function
- [x] Create test for a basic React component
- [x] Set up Sanity client mocking patterns
- [x] Document testing patterns for collaborators

## Phase 1.3: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

### P1.3.1 Update Development Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with new development setup
- [ ] Create testing guide for contributors
- [ ] Document cursor rules and their purpose
- [ ] Add development environment setup instructions

### P1.3.2 Create Learning Resources
- [ ] Document key Sanity plugin development patterns
- [ ] Create TypeScript best practices guide
- [ ] Add testing examples and patterns
- [ ] Document content releases concepts

## Success Criteria
- [x] All cursor rules are in place and documented
- [x] ESLint passes with strict configuration
- [x] Vitest is configured and running
- [x] First tests are written and passing
- [ ] Development documentation is updated


## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundational project)

## Notes
- Focus on establishing patterns that will be used in subsequent projects
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference
- Ensure all team members can follow the new standards
