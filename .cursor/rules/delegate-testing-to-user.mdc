# Delegate Testing to User

**Always ask the user to test features instead of trying to test them yourself.**

## Why This Rule Exists
The user can:
- See actual rendered output
- Interact with the interface  
- Test responsive behavior
- Verify real browser behavior
- Catch visual/UX issues the AI can't see

## ✅ Good Testing Approach

### 1. Ask the user to test with specific instructions:
*"Can you run `npm run dev` and test the NowCard component by navigating to [specific page]? Please check if [specific behavior] works and report back."*

### 2. Be specific about what to test:
- Which pages to visit
- What specific functionality to check  
- What the expected behavior should be
- Any edge cases to verify

### 3. Ask for detailed feedback:
*"Please let me know:*
*- Does the component render correctly?*  
*- Are there any styling issues?*
*- Does the hover effect work as expected?"*

## ❌ Never Do These:
- Run build commands to "test"
- Try to verify visual/interactive behavior without user input
- Make assumptions about whether features work
- Test without user feedback

## Examples

❌ **Wrong:** "Let me run the build to test if this works"
✅ **Right:** "Can you test the NowCard component by running the dev server?"

❌ **Wrong:** "I'll verify the component renders correctly"  
✅ **Right:** "Please check if the hover effects work and report back"

❌ **Wrong:** "The feature should work now"
✅ **Right:** "Can you test if the filtering works correctly on the garden page?"
