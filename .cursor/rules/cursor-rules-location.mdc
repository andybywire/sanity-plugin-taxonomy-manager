# Cursor Rules Location Standards

When creating Cursor rules, always follow these standards:

## Rule File Placement
- Always place rule files in `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`
- Use `.mdc` extension for all rule files
- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

## Directory Structure
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
│       ├── another-rule.mdc
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

## What NOT to do
- Never place rule files in the project root
- Never use subdirectories outside `.cursor/rules`
- Never use extensions other than `.mdc`

## Examples
✅ **Correct:** `.cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc`
❌ **Wrong:** `rules/my-rule.mdc`, `my-rule.mdc`, `.rules/my-rule.mdc`
