# Feature Implementation Plan Standards

When creating implementation plans for a single feature:

- Keep the plan scoped to only that feature.
- Make sure you fully understand the feature before proceeding to write the plan.
- Ask the user questions to clarify your understanding. The user often won't have figured out all the details of a feature before they begin to build it. You should act like an expert product manager and help them think through the user experience and technical implementation of each feature.
- New plans should be markdown files stored inside the "planning" folder. Create this folder if it doesn't exist yet.

## Document Structure

- Maintain a task checklist with checkboxes (- [ ] or - [x])
- Include "Current Phase" and "Overall Progress" summaries
- Write in present tense for current work, past tense for completed work
- Include specific file names and locations when mentioning code changes
- Make notes on completed tasks at the bottom with full details
- Use consistent formatting for task IDs by Phase (P1.1, P1.2, etc.)

## Phase Completion Workflow

After completing each phase of implementation:
- Ask the user to test the implementation and verify it looks correct
- Update the planning document to mark completed tasks as done
- Move detailed completion notes to the bottom of the document
- Update the "Current Phase" and "Overall Progress" sections
- Update the "Last Updated" timestamp using `npm run date` which will give you today's date

## Task Documentation

Each completed task should include:
- Files modified/created
- Key features implemented
- Technical improvements made
- User experience enhancements
- Any issues resolved
