# No Build Commands

**NEVER run these time-consuming commands:**
- `npm run build` (takes too long)
- `npm run dev` (long-running server)
- `npm start` (long-running server)  
- `yarn build/dev/start` (same issues)
- `pnpm build/dev/start` (same issues)

## Why This Rule Exists
Build and development server commands are:
- Time-consuming and slow down workflow
- Long-running processes that the user should control
- Better handled by the user in their own terminal

## What To Do Instead

### ✅ For Testing Changes
Say: *"You can test this by running `npm run dev` in your terminal"*

### ✅ For Validation  
Use these verification methods instead:
- Reading files to check syntax
- Using grep/search to verify changes were applied
- Checking imports and references

### ✅ Acceptable Terminal Commands
- File operations (`ls`, `cat`, etc.)
- Quick syntax checks
- Package installations (when explicitly requested)
- Git operations  
- Short-running utilities

## Examples

❌ **Wrong:** "Let me run `npm run build` to test this"
✅ **Right:** "The changes are ready - start your dev server to test"

❌ **Wrong:** "I'll run `npm run dev` to verify"  
✅ **Right:** "Can you run `npm run dev` and check if the component renders correctly?"
