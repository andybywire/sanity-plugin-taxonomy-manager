 *   a `drafts.` version, or
 * - get any published document in the .concepts[] array, except those
 *   with a `conceptId` in the "drafts" list. This eliminates returning
 *   both the draft and published versions of the same document.
 * - in both cases, returned documents must have the _id of the parent
 *   of this child in their .broader[] array.
